	<para>
		Bundlor scans for JAR files located anywhere in the bundle.  If it detects this file, it runs the entire set of
		analyzers against it. The imports and exports of the JAR file are added to the bundle's manifest and the
		JAR file is placed on the bundle's <literal>Bundle-Classpath</literal>.
