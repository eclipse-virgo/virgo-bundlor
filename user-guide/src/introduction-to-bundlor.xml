    	<title>About Bundlor</title>
		<para>
			With the increasing focus on OSGi in Enterprise Java, there has been increasing focus on creating OSGi
			bundles for deployment.
			When a development team is creating their own bundles, bundlor simplifies the creation and maintenance of
			the OSGi metadata of each bundle.
		</para>
		<para>
			Bundlor also helps in the use of third-party enterprise libraries, many of which are not packaged as OSGi bundles.
			In this case, developers must add OSGi metadata to the library before use.
		</para>
		<para>
			Bundlor helps in both these scenarios. It can be very hard for developers to keep track of the
			dependencies needed by a JAR file. Bundlor is a tool that automates the detection
			of dependencies and the creation of OSGi manifest directives for JARs after their creation. Bundlor takes as
			input a JAR and a template consisting of a superset of the standard OSGi manifest headers. Bundlor analyses
			the source code and support files contained in the JAR, applies the template to the results, and generates a
			manifest.
		</para>
		<para>
			The use of Bundlor can take different forms, from an Apache ANT task and an Apache Maven plugin, to
			simple command line execution.
