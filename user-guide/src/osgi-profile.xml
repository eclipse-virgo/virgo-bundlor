	<title>OSGI Profiles and Bundlor</title>
	<para>
		When managing and transforming the many bundles included in the SpringSource Enterprise Bundle Repository, it
		can become difficult to remember which packages are boot delegated, which are exported from the system bundle,
		and which are from other bundles in your system. This information is important because you typically do not want
		to import packages into your own application that are boot delegated, you want to import system bundle packages
		at version <literal>0</literal>, and you want to define custom imports for all the rest of the bundles. Trying
		to keep track of which packages are in each of these categories can be error prone; similarly, defining template
		entries for them in your manifest template can be time-consuming and tedious.
	</para>
	<para>
		To solve this problem, you can specify that Bundlor take an
		<xref linkend="osgi-profiles.about">OSGI profile</xref> as input and automatically add template entries for boot
		delegated packages and system bundles. These import entries would ignore boot-delegated packages and set the
		version of system bundles to <literal>version="0"</literal>. This feature is available for all Bundlor front
		ends: command-line, ANT and Maven.

		<title>Overview of OSGI profiles</title>
		<para>
			An OSGi profile defines the packages that a particular OSGI runtime (such as dm Server) exports from the
			system bundle and the packages that it delegates to the boot class loader. An OSGI profile isn't an actual
			file; rather, it is two properties that are well known to an OSGi runtime. However, when you pass these
			properties to Bundlor, you pass them as a file, as described in the next section. The properties that make
			up an OSGI profile are as follows.
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				The <literal>org.osgi.framework.system.packages</literal> property defines the packages exported from
				the system bundle.
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				The <literal>org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation</literal> property defines the packages that are boot
				delegated.
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>
			If you are using dm Server as your OSGI runtime, see the file
			<literal>DM_SERVER_HOME/lib/java6-server.profile</literal> for its OSGI profile, where
			<literal>DM_SERVER_HOME</literal> refers to the main installation directory of dm Server. If you are using
			another OSGI runtime, such as Equinox, then see their documentation for their OSGI profile.
		</para>
		<para>
			For additional information about the syntax of the values of these properties, see sections 3.8.3 and 3.8.5
			of the <ulink url="http://www.osgi.org/Specifications/HomePage">OSGI specification</ulink>.

		<title>Using OSGI profiles with Bundlor</title>
		<para>
			The first step in using OSGI profiles with Bundlor is to create a file that contains a textual
			representation of the two properties that make up an OSGI profile:
			<literal>org.osgi.framework.system.packages</literal> and
			<literal>org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation</literal>. What you include in this file is up to you, but
			typically you start with the OSGI profile of the OSGI runtime you are using, and then customize it to fit
			your environment.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you are using dm Server as your OSGI runtime, you can start by copying the section of the file
			<literal>$DM_SERVER_HOME/lib/java6-server.profile</literal> that refers to the two properties and pasting it
			into your text file. If you are using another runtime, consult their documentation.
		</para>
		<para>
			The following snippet shows a partial OSGI profile for dm Server; for clarity only a few packages are shown.
			The example shows the format in which you should create your own OSGI profile file.
		</para>
		<programlisting>org.osgi.framework.system.packages = \
 javax.accessibility,\
 javax.activation,\
 javax.activation;version="1.1.0",\
 javax.activity,\
 javax.annotation,\
...

org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation = \
 com_cenqua_clover,\
 com.cenqua.*,\
 com.yourkit.*,\
...</programlisting>
		<para>
			Once you've created your OSGI profile file, the method of passing it to Bundlor depends on the front end you
			are using to generate a manifest. For detailed information about using the various front ends, see
			<xref linkend="usage"/>.
